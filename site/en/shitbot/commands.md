# Commands and permissions

`/shitbot whitelist` is available on every platform and requires `shitbot.admin`. Use `/shitbot whitelist add - Steve` for a whitelist entry without QQ, or `/shitbot whitelist add 123456789 Steve` to add a QQ binding directly. See [Plugin API and whitelist management](/en/shitbot/api.md#administrator-commands) for removal, pagination, and QQ lookups.

QQ examples on this page use `language: "en_US"`. For Chinese aliases, use `zh_CN` and the [Chinese command reference](/shitbot/commands.md).

## Administration commands

The main command is `/shitbot`, with alias `/sbot`.

| Command | Purpose | Permission |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/shitbot status` | Show database, OneBot, and runtime status | None |
| `/shitbot reload` | Reload configuration, database, OneBot, images, and command services | `shitbot.admin` |
| `/shitbot update` | Download and install an update for this platform | `shitbot.admin` |
| `/shitbot image` | Generate an online status image manually | `shitbot.admin` |
| `/shitbot editor` | Create a short-lived, one-time editor login URL | `shitbot.admin` |
| `/shitbot migrate easybot [EasyBot.db]` | Import EasyBot bindings | `shitbot.admin` |

Spigot and Nukkit-MOT grant `shitbot.admin` to OPs by default. BungeeCord and Velocity check it through their platform permission systems.

`/shitbot reload` creates a new runtime first and retains the old one if loading fails. Restart normally after JAR, Java, or TLS file changes.

## QQ binding

Built-in English aliases:

```text
bind <Minecraft ID> <verification code>
/bind <Minecraft ID> <verification code>
```

The code is generated when an unbound player tries to join. The `binding` settings control QQ/Minecraft ID binding rules.

## Online status and inventories

Built-in English commands:

```text
server status
online players
inventory
my inventory
inventory <Minecraft ID>
my inventory <Minecraft ID>
profile
profile <Minecraft ID>
```

When a Minecraft ID is supplied, ShitBot verifies that it belongs to the sender's QQ account. You cannot query another user's character.
The profile command follows the same ownership rule and uses the newest binding when no ID is supplied. Its built-in card puts the skin on the left and optional permission group, points, and persisted online time on the right. Empty or unavailable PlaceholderAPI values are omitted.

## TPS

Configure TPS in `commands.yml`:

```yaml
tps:
  enabled: true
  permission: ""
  server: ""
```

Aliases, success text, and failure text are under `console.tps` in the selected language file.

- Standalone servers and Nukkit-MOT query locally.
- Proxies can specify a default backend in `server`.
- Group members can append a backend, for example `TPS survival`.
- An empty `permission` skips the game permission check, but group restrictions and cooldowns still apply.

## QQ shortcuts

Define each shortcut under `shortcuts` in `commands.yml`:

```yaml
shortcuts:
  luckperms-editor:
    enabled: true
    command: "lp editor"
    permission: "shitbot.admin"
    allow-unbound: false
    target: "backend"
    server: ""
    capture-seconds: 5
```

Built-in aliases and reply templates are under `console.shortcuts.<name>` in the language file. For a new custom shortcut without a corresponding language entry, `aliases`, `message`, and `failed` in `commands.yml` are fallbacks.

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `aliases` | Trigger text in QQ |
| `command` | Console command without the leading `/` |
| `permission` | Game permission required for the bound character; empty skips the game permission check |
| `allow-unbound` | Allow unbound QQ accounts; off by default |
| `target` | `backend` runs on a Bukkit backend; `proxy` runs on BungeeCord/Velocity |
| `server` | Default backend; if empty, prefer the bound character's current backend |
| `capture-seconds` | Time to wait for and collect new console log output |

An empty `permission` still requires a bound character by default. Only an explicit `allow-unbound: true` permits unbound group members; use it carefully because it weakens the permission boundary.

Group members can override `server` by appending a backend:

```text
lp editor survival
```

## Advanced QQ image commands

Advanced templates do not register commands themselves. Declare each group entry explicitly under `image-templates.commands` in `commands.yml`:

```yaml
image-templates:
  commands:
    player-card:
      enabled: true
      aliases:
        - "my card"
      template: "player-card"
      player-source: "argument"
      target-server: "survival"
      permission: "shitbot.image.player-card"
      cooldown-seconds: 10
      usage: "%at% Usage: my card <bound character>"
      failed: "%at% Image generation failed: %result%"
```

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `aliases` | Group triggers; avoid conflicts with built-in commands, TPS, or shortcuts |
| `template` | Published template ID |
| `player-source` | `bound` selects the most recently bound character; `argument` verifies the supplied character belongs to the sender; `none` does not read bindings |
| `target-server` | Spigot backend handling permissions and PAPI in proxy deployments |
| `permission` | Permission required for the selected character; empty skips the check |
| `cooldown-seconds` | Separate cooldown for this template command, keyed by group and QQ |
| `usage` / `failed` | Invalid-argument and rendering-failure replies; support `%at%`, `%result%`, `%command%`, and `%server%` |

Permission requests only check permissions; they do not execute console commands. `player-source: none` with a nonempty `permission` cannot authorize a request because no character is available to check. Enable `custom-image-templates.enabled: true` in `config.yml` as well. See [Image rendering and advanced templates](/en/shitbot/image-templates.md).

## Permission resolution

For a shortcut with a `permission`, a Spigot backend checks:

1. Bukkit permissions if the character is online.
2. LuckPerms, then Vault, then offline OP status if the character is offline.

Proxy-local commands use proxy permissions; LuckPerms on the proxy can provide offline permissions. Nukkit-MOT uses its platform permissions for online characters and LuckPerms, if installed, for offline ones.

## Command output

Before executing a shortcut, ShitBot records the log position. After `capture-seconds`, it reads newly appended content:

- Bukkit reads `logs/latest.log`.
- Nukkit-MOT reads `logs/server.log`.
- Original log files are not modified.
- Each reply retains at most 100 lines and 4,000 characters.
- Player chat, joins/leaves, and command execution logs are removed from the reply copy.
- Player names, UUIDs, IPs, tokens, passwords, and database addresses are redacted in the reply copy.

If execution succeeds without new log output, the bot says so explicitly.

## Applying changes

After saving `commands.yml` or a language file:

```text
/shitbot reload
```

For proxy/backend deployments, finish editing both sides before reloading each instance. Restart after changing transport addresses, certificates, or firewall settings.
